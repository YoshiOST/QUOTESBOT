# Warning Chatblocks is not supported anymore.
Sadly because of CORS permissions and other browser hardening and the developer not particularly updating it. It doesn't really work. However.. there's streamer.bot option I'm developing ;)
## Instructions
1. Download the cbs file which is the bot file.
2. Head to the site [Chatblocks](https://www.instafluff.tv/ChatBlocks/)
3. Drag and drop the file from your computer onto the scripting area
4. Enter the channel you want to attach the bot to (You probably need to be a mod or the streamer to be able to.)
5. Then you are done!
